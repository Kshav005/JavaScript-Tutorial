// In this exercise, you need to create two variables having strings and try adding them together. After doing so, try to find out the type of data type of the result.
// After getting the result, try adding a string to a number and check it's data type too.
// If you couldn't solve the exercise, then don't worry! We have written the solution below but make sure you try it yourself first!
















let a = "Hello"
let b = "World"
let c = 7
let d = a + b
let e = a + c


console.log(d,  typeof d)
console.log(e, typeof e)

// The exercise completes here. Nice work! If you couldn't solve it yourself, then don't worry. Keep on practicing!
