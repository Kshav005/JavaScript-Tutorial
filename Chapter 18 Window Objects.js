// JS can be used to alter the whole webpage. 'document' returns the whole html code in form of an object. If you try to print 'document' in the browser console then you will be able to see many functions.
// In this chapter, we are going to discuss such little useful things which we can use!

// To change the background color of the webpage
document.body.style.background = "green"

//You may create themes using this, altering the webpage color according to the themes you provide!
document.body.style.color = "red"

// Use these codes in any website and you can play with the html elements.


// To manipulate more, we use BOM, the above document object is known as DOM. By using BOM, we can redirect the user to any website. Alert, confirm and warn are part of this BOM. Actually, if you see, these BOM codes are only ran in Browser not in VSCode or any other runtime apps. Use 'location href' to redirect a user.

// This chapter was short but we are going to see many features about them from now on! Also, you can perform exercises till 14! Good luck solving them.
