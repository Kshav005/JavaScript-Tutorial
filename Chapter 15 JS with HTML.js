// The main purpose of JS was to enhance web apps.
// We have learnt mostly everything basic in JS but now we are going to use all these concepts of JS along with HTML and CSS! 

// To use JS in html, we use '<script src="filename.js"></script>' then in filename.js we are going to write down all the necessary JS program for our webpage! For example,

alert("This is JS, welcoming you!")
//Open 'Ch15.html' file in the web browser, and you will see that it will show an alert in the start.

// This is the introduction, but from now on, we will be learning to combine web development with JS. We won't be making seperate source file for learning JS with browser, but instead we are going to create inline JS program. 
// However, creating a seperate JS source file is a good practice as it makes working efficient because it gets saved in cache thus, making the webpage load more faster and helps you to manage such files more clearly without much unecessary HTML codes. See you in the next chapters! From next chapter, I recommend you to run all the JS code in the console browser tab.
