// Hello to new tutorial and in this tutorial we are going to look at the new language which is mostly used in advanced web development skills, and that is the JavaScript. A lot of popular frameworks are created using Javascript so let's look at the first chapter. 
// Before starting, I assume that you already know about Python, or any coding language. Because there are many terms in javascript which are common in other languages too. Like variables, string, float, etc.
// Now let's start.

// First of all in order to use javascript, you need to install nodejs, which is used to run javascript files.

//Secondly, we use comments in javascript by using the double slash (//)



// This is how to print a command in the output.
console.log("Hi ")

// If you want to assign a variable, then use the 'let' keyword.
let a = 8
console.log(a)

// You can also use 'var' keyword to define a variable, but we will learn in the later chapters, that why shouldn't we use this keyword.

// Variables can contain any data type!
// You can change the value of a variable whilst running the code.
let d = 6 
d = "There is a cat"
console.log(d)

// Variables are case sensitive, it means 'a' and 'A', both are different variables.
// A variable can contain letters, digits and symbols.
// Just like in python, you cannot start a variable with an integer.
// Also, like python, you cannot use 'keywords' or reserved words for variables. 'let var = 3' is invalid and will throw an error.

// This chapter ends here, hope you loved the first chapter! Happy coding!
