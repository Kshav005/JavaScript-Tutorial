<!-- A foolish person told you that it is not possible to change the information of a tag using JavaScript. Moreover, to make it a little hard for you. The guy said if it's possible then add the name under 'What is your name?' of webpage according to the user input (name). For eg - 'What is your name?'' is in a form of paragraph tag and then the user will be asked to enter his/her name, then there should be 'My name is __input__' below it. If you couldn't perform the exercise correctly, then the solution has been provided below for you! -->
