// Sometimes we want the user to know about some things, like we want them to input some number or want them to confirm something or the other. These can be do and that's what we are going to discuss in this chapter! Make sure you run all the code in the console tab of the browser.

// ALERT : We have already seen an example of it. It shows the user an alert on the browser
alert("Policeeeeeeeeee")

// PROMPT : Already seen the example of it, used to ask an input from the user, another argument can be passed as default input.
prompt("Enter anything : ", "This one is default")

// CONFIRM : Ask the user 'OK' and 'CANCEL', ok is treated as true while cancel is treated as false.

// However, as everything as two sides, these things also have two sides. The place where the box will appear is justified by the browser. So you don't know whether it will appear on top or left or right or anywhere. 
// This chapter ends here and now let's move to the next chapter and learn about Window Objects!
