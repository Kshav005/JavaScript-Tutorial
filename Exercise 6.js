// Jade has been given a string 'umbrella' and her teacher wants her to print the each character of the string one by one seperated by newline character using loops. Being her friend, she wants you to help her. Will you be able to solve?
// If you couldn't solve the question then don't worry, the solution is already given below. Happy coding!
















// USING FOR LOOP
let a = "umbrella"
for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
    console.log(a[i])
}


// USING WHILE LOOP
let b = 0
while (b<=a.length-1) {
    console.log(a[b])
    b++
}


// The exercise is completed!
