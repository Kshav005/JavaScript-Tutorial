// Write a program which allows the user to get the multiplication table of any number 'n' using while and for loop, both.(Not an actual table but create a multiply system in which the ending number to be multiplied with shoulb 10)
// If you couldn't get it write or finding it hard to code, then no worries, the solution is given below for your help. Good luck coding!!
















// USING WHILE LOOP
let n1 = prompt("Enter a number for multiplication : ")
i = 1
while (i<=10) {
    console.log(n1, "x", i, "=", n1*i)
    i++ 
}

//USING FOR LOOP
let n2 = prompt("Enter a number for multiplication : ")
for (let j = 1; j <= 10; j++) {
    console.log(n2, "x", j, "=", n2*j)
}

// The exercise is completed. Congrats!
